### R1D3
Heard from somewhere you have to switch subjects to keep you entertained when learning. Doing three courses together. Completing the projects assigned by the instructors too. I know this doesn't count towardsbut its more for a push for me as I'm a beginner. I have found way present to code when I have been switching the programs and overall getting a better grasp too. My git commit games are becoming good. thanks to odin I didn't have to memorize it.
